## ORM - Gorm

- Objectâ€“relational mapping (ORM) is a programming technique for converting data between a relational database and the heap of an object-oriented programming language (Wikipedia), like Mybatis in java.
- Using ORM, we can associate a data table in database with a certain class/struct, and by modifying the class/struct instance, we can easily CRUD the database without using SQL statements.
